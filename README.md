### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, I found lectures this week very helpful, especially the introductory lecture on React and how to use props. The lectures could have gone more depth when explaining API calls and how to reference objects in React, as that took me really long to figure out. However, for the most part, lectures and labs this week were helpful in preparing me for the main project.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Given more time, I would put more effort into my project's CSS and making it look more aesthetically pleasing. After looking at project demos from other interns, I definitely think I could've been more creative with my styling. I would also likely add more features, such as a review section. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went well, in terms of functionality. But as said in my previous response, my CSS could've been better. My peers were very creative in their styling choices, such movie descriptions appearing when hovering over movies cards, or bookmark animations for wathed movies. I plan to take inspiration from them in future projects.
